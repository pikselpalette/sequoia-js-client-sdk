- Fix a bug with `ResourcefulEndpoint.all()` where it could miss the final page of results.

## 1.12.2

## 1.12.0

- Add `continue()` to `Query` to allow simple initiation of continuation paging.

## 1.11.0

- When a Sequoia service returns `meta.continue` in the response, follow this for the next page if `meta.next` is not also present.

## 1.10.1

- Adjust through relationship logic to use the relationship filter name to determine the fieldNamePath which needs to be filtered against - this field will not always be present on the originating resource's fields

## 1.10.0

- Add `encodeUri` configuration option. Will cause the client to automatically encode request urls it generates.
- Add addRelatedThroughFields to the Query class, update logic in resourceful_endpoint browse method to use this method to fetch additional fields required on included through relationships to support their use with graphical display descriptors for example.
